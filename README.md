# base16 Gimp Palettes
In case anyone else was looking for base16 Gimp palettes, here is a set of bare-bones templates for generating them and the actual palettes themselves.

Based on [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16), the syntax highlighting color scheme system. These templates output the [Gimp](https://docs.gimp.org/2.9/en/gimp-concepts-palettes.html) .gpl formatted palettes. These palettes are usable in Gimp itself, and also the [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) .svg vector graphics editor.
